# Machine-Learning-with-Iris-Dataset-Capstone-Project-
This repository contains my **Machine Learning practice work** done using **Python in Google Colab** as part of my **capstone learning**.  I explored both **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** learning using the famous **Iris Dataset**.
🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Google Colab ☁️
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
🔹 Dataset
- **Iris Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- 150 samples
- 4 features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- 3 classes:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica
✅ Logistic Regression (Supervised Learning)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained the model using training data
- Predicted flower classes
- Evaluated model using **accuracy score**
✅ K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
- Applied K-Means with 3 clusters
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots
- Plotted cluster centroids
- Predicted cluster for new data points
🔹 Visualizations
- Scatter plots for data points
- Cluster coloring using labels
- Centroids marked using ❌
🔹 Key Learnings
- Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- How `fit()`, `predict()`, `labels_`, and `cluster_centers_` work
- Importance of feature order and data dimensions
- Model evaluation using accuracy
 🔹 Conclusion
This project helped me understand the **core concepts of Machine Learning**, data handling, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
